# Stein Variational Gradient Descent 

**Tensorflow implementation of Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)**


"SVGD is a general purpose variational inference algorithm that forms a natural counterpart of gradient descent for optimization. SVGD iteratively transports a set of particles to match with the target distribution, by applying a form of functional gradient descent that minimizes the KL divergence."
